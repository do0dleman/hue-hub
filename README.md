# Hue Hub
![](https://github.com/do0dleman/hue-hub/blob/master/img/hue-hub.png)

This is a single page application that uses [do0dle-colors](https://github.com/do0dleman/do0dle-colors) library for generating color schemes based on a single "seed" color. This project is based on my previous one - [Colors](https://github.com/do0dleman/colors) even though the project was almsot completely rewritten.
